## Training from scratch
For the training stage, you should runï¼š
```bash
python tools/dist_train.py --cfg experiments/coco/higher_hrnet/w32_256_adam_lr1e-3.yaml
```
For the testing stage, you should run:
```bash
python tools/valid.py --cfg experiments/coco/higher_hrnet/w32_256_adam_lr1e-3.yaml
```
